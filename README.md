# CI Integration – SDET Notes Repository

This repository is a **structured learning and reference space** documenting my end-to-end understanding of **Continuous Integration (CI)** from an **SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) perspective**.

It is not a collection of random notes. Each file reflects a **deliberate learning phase**, practical experimentation, failures, fixes, and final consolidation of CI concepts as they are used in real-world engineering teams.

## What This Repository Contains

This repository focuses on **CI fundamentals, design thinking, and reliability**, rather than tool-only explanations.

Key themes covered:

* Continuous Integration as a process (not just a tool)
* GitHub Actions and workflow orchestration
* CI pipelines, jobs, steps, and runners
* Dependency installation and caching
* Test frameworks and pytest
* Parametrization, negative testing, and boundary analysis
* PR-based CI and quality gates
* Flaky tests and CI reliability
* SDET mindset applied to CI design

---

## 📂 Notes Structure

Each Markdown file represents a **clear learning milestone**:

* **CI Integration From Scratch – Detailed Notes**
  Step-by-step breakdown of CI starting from zero, including setup, first failures, and fixes.

* **CI Integration – Continued**
  Deeper exploration of workflows, pipelines, and execution flow in GitHub Actions.

* **SDET Foundations – CI, Framework, Caching**
  Core concepts explaining how CI interacts with test frameworks, dependency management, and caching.

* **CI Dependency Installation & Test Execution**
  Focused explanation on how CI installs dependencies, why it happens every run, and how caching improves performance.

* **CI Final Consolidated Notes – SDET Perspective**
  A complete, polished consolidation of all CI topics, written for long-term recall and interview readiness.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

The goal of this repository is to:

* Build **strong fundamentals** in CI before moving to API and UI automation
* Understand *why* CI behaves the way it does, not just *how*
* Learn CI as an **enforced quality system**, not a checkbox
* Develop SDET-level thinking around test reliability and quality gates

---

## 🧠 How to Use These Notes

* Read chronologically to follow the learning journey
* Use the consolidated notes for quick revision
* Refer back during API automation and framework design
* Use as preparation material for interviews and discussions

---

## 🚀 Next Phase

CI is now complete at a foundational SDET level. The next logical progression from this repository is:

* API automation with CI integration
* Applying negative testing and BVA at the API layer
* Scaling CI practices across larger test suites

> This repository reflects **learning through doing**, breaking things, fixing them, and understanding the reasoning behind every step.
