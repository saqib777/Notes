I created another project and named it Python Foundation, this is to learn python and how selenium works, in the last project I was able to understand how selenium works. I now have installed Selenium into a virtual environment and test the project and the selenium works fine.

How to install selenium:

It is always recomended to download it in a virtual environment, hence follow these steps

1. In VS Code, click - ctrl+shift+P,
2. then type: `python: create environment`
3. 2 options will pop up, click on VENV.
4. A virtual enviroment will be created

Alternatively, you can open terminal and type" `python -m venv .venv`
and activate it by `.venv/bin/activate`

Once this is done  

You can install Selenium by typing this in the terminal where the VENV is activated `pip install selenium`

```
Python talks to selenium
selenium talks to webdrivers
webdrivers talk to chrome
```
